# Fake Product API

A lightweight mock product API built with Node.js and Express ‚Äî perfect for frontend demos, prototyping, and testing.  
Products are stored as Markdown files with frontmatter, making them easy to manage without a database.

This project includes **20 sample products** out of the box ‚Äî and you're free to add your own.

The goal is to **generate a `products.json` file** for use in frontend apps or prototypes.

```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a4arjun/fakeproducts.git
cd fakeproducts
npm install
```

## Generate JSON

```bash
npm run generate:products
```

This reads all `.md` files in `products/` and outputs `products.json"` at 

```bash
public/data/
```


This JSON file can be used directly in any frontend or mock app.

## Start the Server (Optional)

You can use the built-in Express API to serve the generated data.

```bash
node server.js
```

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                    |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/api/products`              | Get all products               |
| GET    | `/api/products/:id`          | Get product by ID              |
| GET    | `/api/products/brand/:brand` | Get all products by brand name |

## Image Handling (optional)

Place product images inside `public/images/`.

Use relative paths in the frontmatter, like this:

```json
"image": "/images/iphone-16.png"
```

These images will be served at 

```bash
http://localhost:3000/images/iphone-16.jpg
```

## Batch Image Resizing (Optional)

If you'd like to resize all product PNGs to a consistent size using sharp.

- Place unedited images inside `public/raw/`.
- The resized versions will overwrite any files in `public/images/`
- Then run:

```bash
npm run resize:images
```

## Ideal for

- Frontend demo apps

- Portfolio projects

- E-commerce mockups

- Mobile filtering UI/UX
